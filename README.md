Personal Web Page.

Every morning I get up and take shower and dry my hair in front of mirror.
Just right next to mirror, I have mounted old iPad 1 on the wall, so I could catch up some news and weather.
However since my both hands are busy, I couldn't watch and scroll webpages and touch and so on.

PWP is developed for 3 count down date for important D-Days, current time, and RSS feed, and weather all together in one page.

My three main goal was:
1. Develop as a webapp to take advantage of ability of displaying in many internet connected devices
2. Should work without database so it could use minimal server resources, like raspberry Pi.
3. Responsive design to fit in any resolution, since it could be displayed in TV or projector screens.
plus. if it looks good.

So, here it is.
All codes are with mess, but well, it's my bad.
